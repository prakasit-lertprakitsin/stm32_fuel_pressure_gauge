# 🚗 STM32 Fuel Pressure Gauge

**A real-time fuel pressure monitoring system using STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) and an analog fuel pressure sensor.**

This project reads analog signals from a fuel pressure sensor, processes them using the STM32's built-in 12-bit ADC, and outputs the pressure reading in physical units (e.g., PSI) via Serial Monitor or an optional display. It is suitable for automotive applications or mechanical systems requiring accurate pressure diagnostics.

## 🧰 Features

- ✅ Reads analog pressure sensor (0.5V–4.5V range)
- 📏 Converts ADC value (0–4095) to real-world pressure (e.g., 0–100 PSI)
- 🔧 Uses STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) for fast, accurate ADC reading
- 💻 Live output to Serial Monitor or optional OLED/LCD display
- ⚠️ Configurable alert threshold for over/under pressure
- 📊 Sensor calibration and scaling included

## 🔩 Hardware Requirements

| Component                  | Description                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) | 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller     |
| Fuel Pressure Sensor       | Analog output (e.g., 0.5–4.5V, 0–100 PSI)|
| 3.3V Regulator (optional) | If sensor is powered from 5V             |
| OLED Display (optional)   | I2C interface (e.g., SSD1306 128x64)     |
| USB to Serial Adapter      | For flashing or Serial Monitor           |

> ⚠️ Important: STM32 ADC input pins only accept 0–3.3V. Use a voltage divider or ensure the sensor output doesn't exceed this.

📈 Sensor Calibration

Most pressure sensors output a voltage between 0.5V and 4.5V corresponding to 0–100 PSI.

Example formula:

float voltage = adcValue * (3.3 / 4095.0);
float pressurePSI = mapFloat(voltage, 0.5, 4.5, 0, 100);

You may need to adjust the mapFloat() parameters based on your specific sensor.

🧪 Example Code Snippet

int adcValue = analogRead(PA0); // Read ADC from analog pin
float voltage = adcValue * (3.3 / 4095.0); // Convert to voltage
float pressure = mapFloat(voltage, 0.5, 4.5, 0, 100); // Convert to PSI

Serial.print("Fuel Pressure: ");
Serial.print(pressure);
Serial.println(" PSI");

Helper function:

float mapFloat(float x, float in_min, float in_max, float out_min, float out_max) {
  return (x - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min;
}
